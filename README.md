# Cyber security for healthcare via reinforcement learning

DeepGuard Inc., a leading cybersecurity company for healthcare industries, is facing an increase in the complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks. The need to protect sensitive patient information and ensure regulatory compliance is crucial to maintaining customer trust and data security.

**Project benefits:** implementing advanced reinforcement learning algorithms to simulate and mitigate attack and defense scenarios offers significant benefits:

- **Defense improvement:** training defensive agents in simulated scenarios to develop robust and adaptable protection strategies.
- **Vulnerability identification:** simulation of attacks to identify and resolve vulnerabilities in network systems before they can be exploited by real attackers.
- **Technological innovation:** using advanced reinforcement learning techniques to foster innovation and continuously improve cyber defense capabilities.
- **Resource optimization:** automate attack and defense simulation to reduce human workload and optimize enterprise resource allocation.

**Project details:** GreenGuard Solutions commissioned the development of an advanced cybersecurity solution based on Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The project focuses on the application of two main algorithms within the gym-idsgame environment, which specializes in attack and defense simulations in computer networks.

**Project goals:**

1. **SARSA algorithm:** use SARSA to address "random attack" scenarios in the gym-idsgame environment.
2. **DDQN algorithm:** implement Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) with PyTorch to solve "random attack" and "maximal attack" scenarios.

**Deliverable:** the project requires the delivery of a Google Colab notebook divided into two main sections, each dedicated to one of the two Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Each section should contain detailed explanations of the proposed solutions, justifying the choices made and analyzing the results obtained.

**Project reason:** GreenGuard Solutions places the highest priority on cybersecurity in the healthcare industry. Using advanced Reinforcement Learning algorithms to simulate and mitigate cyber risks allows the company to strengthen its defensive capabilities and protect computer networks against increasingly sophisticated attacks. By automating attack simulation, GreenGuard optimizes operational efficiency and confirms itself as a leader in cybersecurity technology innovation in the healthcare industry.
